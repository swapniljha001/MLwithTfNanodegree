# Machine Learning with Tensorflow Nanodegree

## Project 1 Finding Donors for CharityML

### Description
CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. After nearly 32,000 letters were sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. With nearly 15 million working Californians, CharityML has brought you on board to help build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail. Your goal will be evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.

### Starting the Project
For this assignment, we are provided with the `p1_charityml` folder containing the necessary project files on the Supervised Learning GitHub, under the starter folder. This project contains three files that you will need to use:
* [github.com/udacity/cd0025-supervised-learning](https://github.com/udacity/cd0025-supervised-learning)

* `finding_donors.ipynb`: This is the main file where you will be performing your work on the project.
* `census.csv`: The project dataset. You'll load this data in the notebook.
* `visuals.py`: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project.

## Project 2 Image Classifier

### Description
Define and train a neural network in TensorFlow that learns to classify images; going from image data exploration to network training and evaluation.

## Project 3 Identify Customer Segements with Arvato

### Description
Study a real dataset of customers for a company, and apply several unsupervised learning techniques in order to segment customers into similar groups and extract information that may be used for marketing or product improvement.
